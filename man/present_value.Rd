\usage{
present_value(
  cashflow = NULL,
  r = NULL,
  terminal_period = NULL,
  simple = F,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cashflow}{a collection of cashflows made to an idealized bank - a cashflow stream (positive and negative)}

\item{r}{interest rate (in percent)}

\item{terminal_period}{after how many future periods the cashflow should be realized. if this is zero, then
the terminal period is the last time step a cashflow transaction occurs (e.g., length(cashflow)).}

\item{simple}{Use linear (default) or exponential discounting}

\item{verbose}{should verbose logging be used}
}
\value{
returns the value of the cashflow at period 0
}
\description{
computes the present value of some cashflow stream using the provided interest rate,
cashflow transaction, compounding type and termin period.
