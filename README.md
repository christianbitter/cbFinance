Exploration of financial topics with R.

## Book Content

In the inst\\examples folder you will find content I reproduced from books I found interesting. Since some of these example use data, you will find example data sets under data. Typically, these are security data from certain time ranges, such as Amazon stock for 2010 - 2013 and so on.
